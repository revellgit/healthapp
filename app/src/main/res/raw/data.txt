I am in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing
Conscious breathing is my anchor
You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing
Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen
Make way for the unprecedented and watch your reality rearrange yourself
Open your heart and drink in the glorious day
Am I good enough? Yes I am
The perfect moment is this one
I am deliberate and afraid of nothing
Your life is about to be incredible
